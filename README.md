#### API Testing

The APIs underwent local testing in the development phase, with the primary testing conducted as an integral part of the front-end repositories. This included manual testing of the actual APIs through form inputs and page loads.

pep8 testing was applied to all folders, revealing several small issues such as lines exceeding length limits, unnecessary blank spaces, indentation problems, and docstring concerns.

All identified issues were addressed, with the exception of extended lines in migration files and settings.

Unit testing was carried out as well on the Posts app following along with the walkthrough material for DRF_API
You can find the unit testing [here](https://github.com/JamieB92/Gamer-Connect-Backend-PP4).


## Bugs 

Presented below is a comprehensive list of bugs identified during the development phase. Each bug is accompanied by its individual issue story, and you can access a detailed investigation for each one at the provided link.

 - [Issue 19](https://github.com/JamieB92/Gamer-Connect-Backend-PP5/issues/19) - Unable to Upload Video to Cloudinary.
 - [Issue 1](https://github.com/JamieB92/gamer-connect-frontend-pp5/issues/1) - Dev server wont open after install of React Gitpod template.
 - [Issue 2](https://github.com/JamieB92/gamer-connect-frontend-pp5/issues/2) - User would stay signed in even the logout function was called.
 - [Issue 5](https://github.com/JamieB92/gamer-connect-frontend-pp5/issues/5) - When Uploading a image or a video displaying incorrect route directory to access files. 
 - [Issue 7](https://github.com/JamieB92/gamer-connect-frontend-pp5/issues/7) - Post not showing preview of video and throwing an error when clicking play on mobile browser
 - [Issue 21](https://github.com/JamieB92/Gamer-Connect-Backend-PP5/issues/21) - Unable follow and unfollow a user


### [Issue 6](https://github.com/JamieB92/gamer-connect-frontend-pp5/issues/6) - User getting logged out as soon as page refreshes on a mobile browser.

The identified issue is a known bug preventing the application from opening on Apple mobile devices on various browsers. Specifically, when users attempt to log in, they are redirected back to the login page. This bug stems from the failure to save cookies in the local storage. 
#### To address this issue on Safari web browsers, it is necessary to disable "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" in the browser settings.

For a further release I am looking at resolving this by deploying both the Heroku apps to one domain which I believe will resolve the issue.
I have linked in the issue the steps needed to take to do this and will be looking to implement in the new year.
